# Install Key Software
* Critical development tools
  * Android Studio - Ladybug - https://developer.android.com/studio
  * Slack - https://slack.com/downloads/windows 
* 3D design software??
* Slicing software for 3D printer??
* Discord app??
* Additional tools per https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/laptops/laptops.html 
  * REV Hardware Client - https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client 
    * This can update the REV Driver Station, but maybe it’s better to just do it via the Software Manager app on the Driver Station (see https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/ftc_sdk/updating/ds_app/Updating-the-DS-App.html )
  * GitHub Desktop - https://desktop.github.com/download/ 
    * Maybe this will make interfacing to GitHub easier, or should we just use Android Studio?

# Configure Software

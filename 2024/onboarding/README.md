Assuming your intentions are pure, I'm glad to have authored this guide to help you along your path to enlightenment. This is not intended to be an exhaustive, all-encompassing, "from scratch" guide. It's intended to assist you in making something meaningful happen with relatively minimal understanding and effort.

If you're interested in learning more about the fundamentals, I recommend starting with the FIRST's [Control System Introduction](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/shared/control_system_intro/The-FTC-Control-System.html#)

### Requirements

This guide assumes you have access to all of the following, and assumes.

- [REV Robotics Control Hub](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1595/)
- [12V 3000mAh battery](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1302/) or equivalent
- [REV Driver Hub](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1596/)
- [REV USB PS4 Compatible Gamepad](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-2983/) or equivalent

It also assumes the Control Hub is wired to a battery via switch as shown in the below diagram: ![REV Control Hub Layout](images/rev-control-hub-layout.jpg)

## Introduction
The FullMetalFalcons FTC Team focuses on designing, building, and programming robots to compete in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). This document outlines the technical aspects of our work, including development tools, hardware components, and software practices.

## Development Environment
### Software
- **IDE:** We use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for robot programming.
- **Programming Language:** Java is the primary language for our robot code.
- **Libraries:** We utilize the FTC SDK provided by FIRST.

### Setup
1. Install Android Studio.
2. Clone the team's repository from GitHub.
3. Open the project in Android Studio.
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Robot Hardware
### Components
- **Control Hub:** The main processing unit for the robot.
- **Motors:** Used for driving and manipulating robot mechanisms.
- **Sensors:** Includes gyroscopes, encoders, and distance sensors.
- **Servos:** Used for precise control of robot parts.

### Wiring
- Follow the wiring diagram provided in the FTC documentation.
- Ensure all connections are secure and labeled.

## Programming
### Code Structure
- **OpModes:** The main entry points for robot control during matches.
  - **Autonomous:** Code for autonomous operation.
  - **TeleOp:** Code for driver-controlled operation.
- **Subsystems:** Modular components of the robot, such as drivetrain and arm.

### Best Practices
- Use descriptive variable and method names.
- Comment your code to explain logic and functionality.
- Follow the team's coding standards and style guide.

## Version Control
### Git Workflow
1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone [repository-url]`
2. **Create a Branch:** `git checkout -b [branch-name]`
3. **Commit Changes:** `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
4. **Push to Remote:** `git push origin [branch-name]`
5. **Create a Pull Request:** Submit your changes for review.

### Repository Structure
- **master:** Stable code ready for competition.
- **development:** Active development branch.
- **feature-branches:** Individual features or fixes.

## Testing and Debugging
### Simulation
- Use the FTC SDK's built-in simulation tools to test code without hardware.

### On-Robot Testing
1. Deploy code to the Control Hub.
2. Test individual components before full system tests.
3. Use telemetry to monitor sensor values and debug issues.

### Debugging Tools
- **Logcat:** View logs and debug information in Android Studio.
- **Telemetry:** Send real-time data from the robot to the driver station.

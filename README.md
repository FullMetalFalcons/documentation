# Documentation

## New students - beginner setup and tutorials
For anyone interested in coding anything see the [beginners](https://github.com/FullMetalFalcons/beginners) repository for information on getting started with github, and how to make productive and proper contributions to any existing code you have permissions to modify.

## Robot Interaction
For interacting with the robot see the [robot-basics](robot-basics.md) page

## Control System Documentation & Environment Set-Up
For a list of documentation links for the control system and how to set up the environment for development (LabVIEW, etc.) see [2018 important links](important-links.md).

## Mentors - Repository Setup
When creating/modifying a repository it is imperative that you add teams to the collaborators section under settings.  This separation of concerns ensures only specific students have write access to a particular repository and ensures we can track who modifies things at all times.

note that no one can read or write or modify a repository except the creator/owner until the permissions are set, so this should be done immediately after creating the repository
1. open a repository from the main page, or via the repository tab for the organization
2. click the `settings` cog/gear icon
3. click `collaborators & teams`
4. click the dropdown `add a team: *select team*`
5. select each team until all are listed on the main page and the dropdown is no longer visible
6. click each team's dropdown and change from `read` to `write` if that particular sub-group of students requires write permissions to the repo
7. `mentors` should always have `admin` on all repos to allow for modification of everything, etc
8. these settings are saved when the green checkmark is displayed, there is no explicit save button for team permissions
